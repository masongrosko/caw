# Automatically discover tests from files matching the pattern 'test_*.py' or '*_test.py'
# pytest will only find test functions that match this pattern by default

# Or simply omit this if `testpaths` and `python_files` are sufficient
# pytest will recursively look in all subdirectories for matching test files
